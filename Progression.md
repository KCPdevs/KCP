# Overview of planned progression for the pack
*  Don't need to be terribly detailed, but lay out bullet points in the general order the player will do or unlock things.
## Back to Basics
* Player gets armour and food via quest.
* Get wood
  * Note wooden hoppers and drying racks (Edited to be able to turn rotten flesh into leather)
* Flint tools required to mine stone.
* Get tinkers smelter and furnace going. 
  * Use fluid channels for early fluid transportation (mostly lava)
* Upgrade to Metal tools
* Build a High Oven (used to make steel) 
* Recommend tinkers fluid tank for fluid storage 
  * Probably don't need to buff it, it's surprisingly good.
* Get aluminum brass going. 
#### Notes 
* [No more vanilla tools](https://streamable.com/zu3ou9)
* Most early game recipes are unmodified.


## A little more diffcult
* Craft Petal Apothecary (Made with Aluminum Brass and a petal)
* Get mana production going and make a pure daisy
* Unlock Archivne archives as a early game storage option
* Early Starcaller
* Craft a forging hammer to craft early plates
  * Wires can be crafted from these plates
* Craft Mana Fluxfield

#### Notes
* Some kind of reminder at the end of this chapter to get a crop farm going, as a decent number of future recipes will require fermentation

## The Power, It burns!
* Make some LV cables and connectors
  * These will have no buffer.
* Craft Carpenter and Squeezer with Sturdy casings
* Create Mana Sap by squeezing Mana items, and fermenting the diluted mana sap
* Create Mana Steel by combining Mana Sap and steel
* Craft Runic Alter, using custom Abrass plates and mana sap
* Create the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate (**TAP**)
  * And thus terrasteel, which will be used for Heavy Engineering blocks
* Coke Bricks are created in a Carpenter, alongside some mana sap.
* Low Grade methonal is created by fermenting Creosole
  * Used to craft many IE parts
  * Such as pipes, Engineering Blocks, and circuits
* Create metal press
  * Used to create gears, as well as plates and such faster (potentally at a better ratio)
* Create Crusher and Alloy Kin
* Create MV Cables



#### Notes
* Note that Backpacks and Belts exist, and will be useful.
* With botantia Tweaks, you can create custom TAP recipes.
* Belts are easier to make, to encourge usage
* Move LV Capactor here, perhaps after metal press
