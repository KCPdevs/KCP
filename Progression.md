# Broad Overview of planned progression for the pack

## Spawn
* Player gets armour and food via quest.
* Get basic tools and whatnot

## Earlygame
### Pre-power
* Use Practical logistics 2 forging hammer  for prepower plates (also would serve as a method of opening the PL2 questline)
  * Require plates to make machine frames
* Have arcane archives as a storage option for earlygame
  * Personally havent used the mod, may require some balancing to be viable for this stage of the game
