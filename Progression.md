# Overview of planned progression for the pack
## Note major details and all
##Spawn
* Player gets armour and food via quest.
* Get basic tools and whatnot
* [No more vanilla tools](https://streamable.com/zu3ou9)

## Earlygame
### Pre-power
* Use Practical logistics 2 forging hammer  for prepower plates (also would serve as a method of opening the PL2 questline)
  * Require plates to make machine frames
* Have arcane archives as a storage option for earlygame
  * Personally havent used the mod, may require some balancing to be viable for this stage of the game
* Standard Ticon Progression
  * Maybe rebalance some of the materials to mix things up, and to make some materials viable
  * Ticon ore doubling disabled in favor of custom methods (Botantia for earlygame ore doubling?)
* Use Ticon to make aluminum brass for botania.
* Progress in botantia to at least fluxfield

### FluxField
* Gate power behind botania mana, and have it be the sole option for a while.
  * No need to buff fluxfield, it's pretty damn viable on it's own
* Get some form of power transportation
