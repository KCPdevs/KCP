# Overview of planned progression for the pack
Don't need to be terribly detailed, but lay out bullet points in the general order the player will do or unlock things.
## Beginning 
* Player gets armour and food via quest.
* Flint tools required to mine stone.
* Get tinkers smelter and furnace going. 
  * Use fluid channels for early fluid transportation (mostly lava)
* Upgrade to Metal tools 
* Recommend tinkers fluid tank for fluid storage 
  * Probably don't need to buff it, it's surprisingly good.
* Get aluminum brass going. 

#### General notes
* [No more vanilla tools](https://streamable.com/zu3ou9)
* Most early game recipes are unmodified.
