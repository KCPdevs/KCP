# Current ideas list for the pack:

* Gregtech styled ore viens done with e.g. Ore Tweaker
* Mod singularities
  * Like Item type singularities, but focus on the most commonly used items in a given mod.
  * Could be used as part of the craft to make lategame/creative items relevant to that mod
* Item type (dyes, woods, potions etc) singularities
  * Take all of item type (all dye colors, all potion types, etc), put it in either a multiblock or a extended crafting table, get item out
  * Said item would be used for late/endgame crafting
* Expanding upon the TICON seared furnace with modular machinery
* Mixing up how automatic resource generation is done with e.g. new IE Excavator reservoir types.
* Something to do with Ticon shards?
  * Perhaps have them be part of a custom ore processing chain
* IE Biodiesel line as an actual option:
  * IE multi for biodiesel and diesel, higher tier MM machines for higher tier fuels we could creates
* Botania portal can be used to generate some other (non-botania) items as well.
* End game goal: Kharaxium
 * Basically our Ultimate Ingot
 * Long processing chain rather than craft?
* Quests could be done like ftb interactions, but better.
* Second TR Circuit: Magamps, capacitors
* Last TR Circuit: Full semiconductor line inc. Czochralski process. MOSFET, MODFET, etc.
* Arc Furnace speeds up specific stuff
* Life Aggregator
* NC Tough Alloy requires TR Advanced Alloy
* VM Tier 1: Requires TR Advanced Alloy, in turn requiring bending machine
* VM Tier 2: Requires Tough Alloy

Possible ages to work towards:
* Magicky early Age

* Engineering Age
* Technology Age
* (these two maybe combined a little bit)

* Atomic Age
* ProjectE Age

# Ideas implemented
* Start with gear ala omni
* Botantia as a viable/only? early to midgame power source
* Practical logistics 2 forging hammer as earlygame (prepower) plate presser?
* New fluid - Mana Sap, alloyed with steel = manasteel and required for carpenter recipes
* Carpenter for early-game crafting after early Botania
* Usage of manastring to craft Forestry backpacks
